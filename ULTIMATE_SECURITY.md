# NEHONIX FileGuard - Ultimate Security Guide

This document provides detailed information about the ultimate security features of the NEHONIX FileGuard library, which makes data completely unreadable by humans or other systems except by the FileGuardManager class itself.

## Ultimate Security Features

NEHONIX FileGuard implements the highest possible security standards, combining multiple advanced security techniques:

### 1. Multi-Layer Encryption

Data is protected with up to 5 layers of encryption, each using a different algorithm:

- **Layer 1**: AES-256-GCM (Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data)
- **Layer 2**: AES-256-CBC (Cipher Block Chaining)
- **Layer 3**: AES-256-CTR (Counter Mode)
- **Layer 4**: Camellia-256-CBC (Alternative to AES)
- **Layer 5**: ARIA-256-GCM (Korean encryption standard)

Each layer uses a unique derived key, making it virtually impossible to break through all layers even if one algorithm is compromised.

### 2. Memory-Hard Key Derivation

Keys are derived using memory-hard functions that make brute-force attacks computationally expensive:

- **Argon2**: Winner of the Password Hashing Competition, designed to be resistant to GPU, ASIC, and FPGA attacks
- **Balloon Hashing**: Provides memory-hard guarantees with fallback support

These functions require significant memory resources to compute, making large-scale attacks prohibitively expensive.

### 3. Post-Quantum Cryptography

Protection against future quantum computer attacks using:

- **Kyber**: Lattice-based key encapsulation mechanism resistant to quantum attacks
- **Lamport Signatures**: One-time signatures based on hash functions

### 4. Secure Random Generation

All cryptographic operations use secure random number generation:

- **Hardware-based entropy sources** when available
- **CSPRNG (Cryptographically Secure Pseudo-Random Number Generator)**
- **Entropy pooling** to ensure high-quality randomness

### 5. Honeypot Data

Fake data is strategically inserted to confuse attackers:

- **Decoy keys** that look like real encryption keys
- **Fake metadata** that appears legitimate
- **Misleading structures** to complicate reverse engineering

### 6. Algorithm Rotation

Different encryption algorithms are used for each layer to prevent attacks that target a specific algorithm:

- **Automatic rotation** based on layer index
- **Algorithm diversity** to mitigate algorithm-specific vulnerabilities
- **Fallback mechanisms** if certain algorithms are unavailable

### 7. Tamper Protection

Integrity checks detect unauthorized modifications:

- **HMAC authentication** for each layer
- **Digital signatures** for the entire file
- **Checksums** for critical components

### 8. Secure Memory Handling

Sensitive data is protected in memory:

- **Secure memory wiping** after use
- **Constant-time operations** to prevent timing attacks
- **Memory isolation** where possible

## Running the Ultimate Security Demo

To see these security features in action, run:

```bash
npm run demo:ultimate-security
```

The demo will:

1. Generate cryptographically secure keys
2. Create sample data of varying sensitivity
3. Demonstrate encryption at different security levels
4. Show ultra-secure encryption with maximum protection
5. Encrypt and decrypt binary data
6. Showcase the security features in detail

## Implementation in Your Code

To implement the highest security level in your application:

```typescript
import { FileGuardManager, createPersistentRSAFGM } from "nehonix-fileguard";
import * as crypto from "crypto";

// Generate a secure encryption key
const key = crypto.randomBytes(32);

// Create a FileGuardManager with persistent RSA keys
const fgm = createPersistentRSAFGM(key.toString("hex"), {
  rsaKeysPath: "./secure-keys.json",
});

// Data to encrypt
const sensitiveData = {
  title: "TOP SECRET",
  content: "This data requires the highest level of protection.",
  credentials: {
    apiKey: "your-very-sensitive-api-key",
    accessToken: "your-very-sensitive-token"
  }
};

// Configure with maximum security
const config = {
  securityLevel: "max",
  compressionLevel: "maximum",
  layers: 5,
  useAlgorithmRotation: true,
  addHoneypots: true
};

// Encrypt with ultra-secure protection
const result = await fgm.saveWithUltraSecureEncryption(
  "path/to/secure-file.nxs",
  sensitiveData,
  key,
  fgm.rsaKeyPair,
  config
);

// Later, decrypt the data
const decryptedData = await fgm.loadWithUltraSecureDecryption(
  "path/to/secure-file.nxs",
  key,
  fgm.rsaKeyPair
);
```

## Security Best Practices

For maximum security:

1. **Key Management**: Store encryption keys securely, never in plain text
2. **Use Maximum Security Level**: Always use 'max' security level for sensitive data
3. **Enable All Security Features**: Use algorithm rotation, honeypots, and multiple layers
4. **Secure Memory**: Clear sensitive data from memory after use
5. **Regular Key Rotation**: Change encryption keys periodically
6. **Physical Security**: Protect the devices where encrypted files are stored
7. **Access Control**: Limit who can access the encryption keys

## Technical Details

The ultimate security implementation uses:

- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2 with SHA-512, 10,000+ iterations
- **Encryption**: AES-256, Camellia-256, ARIA-256
- **Authentication**: HMAC-SHA-256, GCM authentication tags
- **Compression**: DEFLATE algorithm with maximum compression
- **Post-Quantum**: Kyber-1024 for key encapsulation

## Security Guarantees

With proper implementation, NEHONIX FileGuard provides:

- **Confidentiality**: Data is unreadable without the correct keys
- **Integrity**: Any tampering with the encrypted data is detectable
- **Authentication**: Only authorized users with the correct keys can access the data
- **Forward Secrecy**: Compromise of one file doesn't compromise others
- **Quantum Resistance**: Protection against future quantum computer attacks

Remember that the security of the system depends on keeping the encryption keys secure. The encrypted data is only as secure as the key management system.
